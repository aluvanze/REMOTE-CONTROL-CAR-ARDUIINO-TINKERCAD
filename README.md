# REMOTE-CONTROL-CAR-ARDUIINO-TINKERCAD

This code is an Arduino sketch that controls four motors and two servos based on input from four push buttons. Here's a general description:

Hardware Setup:

Motors: The motors are connected to digital pins 10, 11, 12, and 13.
Buttons: Four buttons are connected to digital pins 4, 5, 6, and 7 to control the motors and servos.
Servos: Two micro servos are attached to pins 2 and 3 using the Servo library.
Functionality:

The code reads the state of each button in the loop. If a button is pressed (HIGH state), it triggers actions:
Buttons 1 & 2: Control the motors. Pressing button 1 activates motors on pins 12 and 13, and button 2 activates motors on pins 10 and 11. Releasing the buttons stops the motors.
Buttons 3 & 4: Control the servos. Pressing button 3 rotates servo 1 to 90 degrees, while pressing button 4 rotates servo 2. Releasing the buttons returns the servos to their default 0-degree position.
Key Features:

The sketch uses simple digital I/O operations to control both motors and servos.
The delay(15) is used after the servo movement commands to ensure smooth rotation.
This code could be used in a simple robotics or automation project where button inputs are used to control movement via motors and servos.
